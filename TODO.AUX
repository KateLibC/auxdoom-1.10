There's stuff to do on the A/UX port?
=====================================

On the off chance that anyone gets some spare time and a live A/UX
system, the following items are still on the to do list:

* Instructions on how to run the game from a full X11 session or MacX.

* Sound volume control is currently wrong.

* Keyboard mappings as the Doom input handler does not seem to like
  the codes from ADB keyboards.

* Test network support.
